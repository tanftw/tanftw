# Winter, a humble beginning

Today 2024-08-10, I'm starting to create a custom assistant for myself.

Why?

Siri is suck, Gemini, Copilot are good but they are generic AI. They can't be customized, can't feed information to them so not useful.

What I want for my custom AI?

- Can access any information that I feed, my notes, photos, code, files, even my browsing history.
- Simple to train.
- Cheap to use.
- Ability to speak, listen.

So, introduction to Winter my new assistant.
